            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Marcus, I'm 21, from Hong Kong, and at the time of writing this, I am in my third year of my <a href="https://www.durham.ac.uk/study/courses/f630/" target="_blank">Environmental Geoscience Degree</a> at Durham University.</p>
            <p>Since I was young, I've always had a fascination for physical geography, and wanted to learn about how our Earth worked. This was thanks to me spending my childhood watching National Geographic, 
               rather than cartoons. At the same time, I also had a deep interest in computers, and I spent a lot of time around them, albeit mostly through videogames. When it was time to apply for universities, 
               that was the time when computer science became an extremely lucrative degree, which often brought high levels of success. I was always aware of this, and always had an interest in the world of coding
               but at the time, my interests were rooted in something else.</p>
            <p>During this (2022) summer however, I found myself with not much to do. I am studying in the UK, and haven't been home for 2 years. I'm lucky to have friends from home that I grew up with go to Durham 
               University with me, however because I spent a year studing at the University of California Irvine, while I am still in my 3rd and final year, they have just graduated this past summer. As they have all
               left Durham now, and due to the complications of COVID entry restrictions in Hong Kong, I had nowhere really to go, and will spend my whole summer in Durham. With all this free time, I always thought of
               learning how to code, but never picked it up, and seeing a tiktok on how someone became a self taught front end developer push started my journey into coding. In the short time I've spent learning HTML, 
               I've found a sense of completeness. Typing code and being able to see how certain things changed on a basic HTML site was really cool to me, and it felt like something I was meant to do. Those who know
               me well know how much time I spend on my computer, and this was when I thought, what better way than to make a career out of it? If I love spending time on computers, and learning about them so much, why 
               not make something out of it. So this basic HTML blog marks the beginnings of a journey, one which I hope to document every step of the way to showcase what I've learnt, and hopefully, be the first of 
               several entries onto my portfolio.</p>
            <h2>What's to Come</h2>
            <p>At this stage, I'm about to finish learning HTML. I will move onto learing CSS and eventually JavaScript and React.JS. I plan to make a copy of this website at each stage of my journey, so after learning CSS
               I will revisit this website and make it again, and hopefully if I've learned a thing or two, it will look very different to this.
            </p>
            <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
            <p>Fun fact, I also enjoy taking 35mm film photos. Here is a photo I took in Milan</p>

            <h2>My Steam Account</h2>
            <p>As mentioned, I've spent a lot of time on video games, my favourite of which are GTA V and CSGO. You can find me on steam <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChoChoNut/" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
